    text: "Osteoporosis is a disease that causes bones to become weak and brittle, \
    making them more vulnerable to fractures from minor stress or falls. It usually affects the hips, \
    wrists and spine. The condition occurs when the formation of new bone doesn't keep up with the loss of old bone. \
    While it can affect anyone, it is most prevalent in older women, especially postmenopausal women, with white and Asian women at the highest risk.",

    text: "There are usually no symptoms in the early stages of bone loss. But once osteoporosis weakens your bones, you may experience the following symptoms:\n \
    - Back pain, caused by a broken or collapsed bone in the spine.\n \
    - Loss of height over time.\n \
    - A stooped posture.\n \
    - A bone that breaks much more easily than expected.",

    text: "Bone mass increases when you are young because new bone is formed faster than old bone breaks down. \
    This process peaks at age 30, after which bone is lost faster than it is made. The likelihood of developing \
    osteoporosis is influenced by peak bone mass reached in youth, which is partly genetic and varies by ethnicity. \
    Higher peak bone mass means more bone 'in the bank,' reducing the risk of osteoporosis as we age.",

    text: "The most serious complications of osteoporosis are bone fractures, \
    particularly in the spine or hip. Hip fractures, often caused by falls, can lead to \
    disability and an increased risk of death within the first year after the injury. In some cases, \
    the vertebrae in the spine can weaken and collapse without a fall, resulting in back pain, lost height, and a hunched-forward posture.",
