        "The data spanning from 2011 to 2021 on hospitalizations for minimal trauma fractures, \
        indicates that for individuals over the age of 65, hip fractures are the most prevalent. \
        Not only are hip fractures the most common, but they can permanently impact one's mobility, \
        and increase the elderlyâ€™s risk of death. Reviews have found that fewer than half of those who \
        suffer a hip fracture return to their pre-fracture level of mobility. The latter emphasizes the importance of \
        being proactive about one's bone health, as many seniors may face long-term challenges in regaining \
        their independence and mobility following such an injury.",
